# Stochastic-Optimization-in-R

Goal: Implementation of stochastic optimizers and convergence analysis based on small and large data sets.

Algorithms implemented: 
- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
- Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (MSGD)
- Stochastic Gradient Descent with Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAGSGD)
- Adaptive Gradient Algorithm (AdaGrad)
- Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp) 
- Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam)

Involved data sets:
1) Small: simulated data (n=1000) with 1 feature
2) Large: weather data (n=96453) with 5 features
